# Similarity Model

ArKanjo represents code duplication as a graph, implemented in the `Similarity_Table` class.

## Overview of similarity calculations

The following TF-IDF and cosine similarity model applies specifically to

1. NLP text similarity using gensim

Other duplication detection methods may use different feature extraction and similarity techniques internally. However, the final representation remains conceptually similar across all methods:
- functions are represented as graph nodes
- similarity relationships are represented as weighted edges
- edge weights represent similarity scores between functions

## Method 1: NLP text similarity using gensim

We have $\mathcal{V}$, where it is defined by the set of all possible words (*tokens*).

$$\mathcal{V}=\{w_1​,w_2​,\dots,w_n\}$$

For each file $d$, we have a list of words.

$$d = \left(\text{"int"}, \text{"main"}, \text{"return"}, \text{"0"}, \dots\right)$$

Each document becomes a counting vector:

$$\text{BoW}(d)=(c_1​,c_2​,\dots,c_n​)$$

where

$$c_i​=\text{number of times that $w_i$ appears in $d$}$$

and then we calculate the relative frequency of the word in the document

$$\text{TF}(w,d)=\frac{\text{freq}(w,d)}{\sum_k\text{freq}(w_k,d)}$$

and Inverse Document Frequency for common words to be less impactful than rare words

$$\text{IDF}(w)=\log\left(\frac{N}{\text{df}(w)}\right)$$

$$N=\text{total number of documents}$$
$$\text{df}(w)=\text{number of documents that contain $w$}$$

concluding the result by the weight of each word as

$$\text{TF-IDF}(w,d)=\text{TF}(w,d)\cdot\text{IDF}(w)$$

Each document becomes a vector $\vec{d}$ defined by

$$\vec{d}=(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)$$
$$x_i=\text{TF-IDF}(w_i,d)$$

Finally, the calculation of similarity between two documents.

$$\text{sim}(d_1,d_2)=\frac{\vec{d}_1\cdot\vec{d}_2}{\lvert\lvert\vec{d}_1\rvert\rvert\cdot\lvert\lvert\vec{d}_2\rvert\rvert}$$

### Intuitions

* Each document: a point in a high-dimensional space

* Similarity: angle between vectors

* Similar code: same words/tokens
* Similar structure: similar distribution of terms

## Graph Model

- Nodes: functions (identified by their path)
- Edges: similarity between functions
- Weight: similarity score ($0.0$ - $1.0$)

```
A ----0.9---- B
 \           /
  +--0.85---C
```

- The graph is undirected

## Threshold

Edges are considered during analysis only if:

$$\text{similarity} \geq \text{threshold}$$

## Implementation

This model is implemented in the `Similarity_Table` class.
